# FinancialCalculatorKit

A native macOS application written in SwiftUI that aims to provide a fully featured and intuitive financial calculator. The goal is to support common financial calculations, historical ticker data visualization, currency conversions, and CSV import/export in a sleek macOS interface.

This repository currently contains the initial project template. Future work will expand the functionality to include:

- Financial calculator functions (TVM, amortization schedules, IRR, NPV, etc.)
- Stock ticker history charts using Swift Charts
- Currency conversion utilities
- CSV data import/export for analysis
- Rich tooltips and inline explanations throughout the UI

The `TODO.md` file outlines planned tasks in more detail.

## Building

Open `FinancialCalculatorKit.xcodeproj` with Xcode 16 on macOS 15 and run the `FinancialCalculatorKit` target. The app uses SwiftData for persistence and requires macOS 15 or later.
