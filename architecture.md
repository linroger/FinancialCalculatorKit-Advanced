# Architecture Overview

This project is a minimal macOS SwiftUI application using **SwiftData** for persistence.

## Components

- **FinancialCalculatorKitApp.swift** – Entry point of the app. Configures `ModelContainer` with the schema containing `Item`.
- **Item.swift** – A simple `@Model` class containing a single `timestamp` property. This is persisted via SwiftData.
- **ContentView.swift** – The main view showing a list of `Item` instances from SwiftData. Allows adding and deleting items. Uses `NavigationSplitView` to provide a master/detail layout on macOS.
- **FinancialCalculatorKitTests** and **FinancialCalculatorKitUITests** – Empty test targets generated by Xcode.

The project currently does not contain any financial calculator logic or custom UI aside from the default Xcode template.

## Current Data Flow

1. `FinancialCalculatorKitApp` creates a `ModelContainer` configured with the `Item` schema and injects it into the SwiftUI environment.
2. `ContentView` uses `@Query` to fetch `[Item]` from the model context. Items are displayed in a `List` where each row is a `NavigationLink` to a text detail view.
3. Items can be added by pressing the toolbar's add button, which creates a new `Item(timestamp: Date())` and inserts it into the model context. Items can be deleted using the built-in `.onDelete` behavior.

## Observations

- The app structure is simple and uses SwiftUI's default styling.
- There is no separation between model, view, and any form of view model or services.
- There are no financial calculation features implemented yet.

This file serves as a baseline before implementing the requested financial calculator features.
