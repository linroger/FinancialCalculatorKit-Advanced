```swift
struct FormulaReference {
    let name: String
    let category: FormulaCategory  
    let level: CFALevel
    let mainFormula: String        // LaTeX
    let variables: [FormulaVariable]
    let derivation: FormulaDerivation?
    let variants: [FormulaVariant]
    let usageNotes: [String]
    let examples: [FormulaExample]
    let relatedFormulas: [String]
    let tags: [String]
}
```

### **LaTeX Rendering**
- Complex mathematical expressions
- Fractions, superscripts, subscripts
- Greek letters (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥, œÉ, Œº, etc.)
- Mathematical operators (‚àë, ‚à´, ‚àÇ, etc.)
- Matrix notation
- Function notation

### **Navigation System**
- **8 Asset Class Categories** with color coding
- **4 CFA Levels** with filtering

## üìñ Formula Examples

### **Bond Pricing with Complete Derivation**
```latex
P = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{PMT}{(1 + \frac{YTM}{m})^t} + \frac{FV}{(1 + \frac{YTM}{m})^n}
```

**Derivation Steps:**
1. Start with present value concept: `PV = CF/(1+r)^t`
2. Apply to periodic coupon payments
3. Add present value of principal
4. Combine components for total bond price

### **Black-Scholes with Dividends**
```latex
C = S_0 e^{-qT} N(d_1) - X e^{-rT} N(d_2)
```

**Complete derivation from risk-neutral pricing**

### **CAPM Derivation**
```latex
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i[E(R_m) - R_f]
```

**Derived from portfolio theory and market equilibrium**
